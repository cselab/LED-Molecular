# Framework for Learning Effective Dynamics for Molecular Systems (LED-Molecular)

Basic code implementation of the paper: *Accelerated Simulations of Molecular Systems through Learning of their Effective Dynamics*, PR. Vlachas, J. Zavadlav, M. Praprotnik, P. Koumoutsakos, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2022, 18, 1, 538â€“549 *https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00809*

The LED-Molecular employs the following neural architectures:
- (AEs) Autoencoders to capture the effective degrees of freedom
- (MDNs) Mixture density networks for stochastic dynamics and probabilistic decoding
- (RNNs) Recurrent neural networks to capture nonlinear markovian dynamics on the latent space (LSTMs and GRUs, etc.)

## Requirements

Code requirements are provided in the requirements.txt file.
The code has been compiled with python version 3.7.
